/*
   There's a typo in the book on line 11 of this file, in the first printf call. 
   There should be commas in between arguments; in the book, there's no comma after the second argument.
   GCC 4.4 complains with (warning: too few arguments for format). 
   The program works, although a bunch of gibberish is printed on the newline before you type in your numbers. 
   
   This version of the source doesn't contain the error.
